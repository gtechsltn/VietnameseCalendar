# Histories
+ Early 19th century: The Gregorian calendar was introduced by the French, and was used in Vietnamese administrative offices.
+ On 8 August 1967: The North Vietnamese government issued a decree to change Vietnamese standard time from UTC+8 to UTC+7, as well as make the Gregorian calendar the sole official calendar, restricting lunisolar calendar use to holidays and commemorations.
+ On 30 April 1975: The Southern Vietnam would later join this change at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
+ Lunar calendars depend on first visibilities of the moon. The Chinese calendar would be centered in Beijing, and that of Vietnam in Hanoi.
